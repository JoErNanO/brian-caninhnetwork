# The CAN-In Neural Network
This repository contains the code used to run the simulations published in our article: *The CAN-In neural network: A mathematical model for theta oscillations and memory maintenance in the hippocampus.*
[Read it on Hippocampus.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22704)

Two main simulation scripts are included: one for the CAN network and one for the CAN-Inhibitory network.
The code runs on the [BRIAN simulator](http://briansimulator.org/).
